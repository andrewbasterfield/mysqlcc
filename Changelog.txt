Changes for 0.9.8
-----------------
* Created a conditional for mysql_shutdown to check for the existance
  of SHUTDOWN_DEFAULT in order to work with older mysql client libraries
* Changed requirement for qpopmenu.h to qpopupmenu.h in include/CProperties.h
  and src/CTableTools.cpp
* Added /usr/share/qt3 to the list of places to look for qt3 (fixes Debian
  problems)

Notes for 0.9.7
----------------
This is a development release. Henceforth, version numbers will follow the Linux
kernel standard wherein odd numbered releases (such as 0.9.7) refer to 
development releases and even numbered releases (such as 0.9.8) refer to stable
releases.

Users connecting to or using MySQL 5 libraries should be using this release.
Users still connecting only to MySQL 4 or lower servers should continue using
version 0.9.4. This is an issue which will be addressed by version 0.9.8 and,
if that version is available at the time you read this, that version should be 
used instead.

Changes for 0.9.7
-----------------
* Changed the call to mysql_shutdown to include SHUTDOWN_DEFAULT as required
  by MySQL >= 5 client libraries in CMySQL.cpp
* Repaired default_table assignment in CQueryWindow.cpp
