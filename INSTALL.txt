Linux Binary Installation
=========================

To install a binary distribution, follow the steps below:

  1. Obtain a distribution file from one of the sites listed in *Note
     Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.

     MySQL Control Center  binary distributions are provided as compressed
     `tar' archives and have names like `mysqlcc-VERSION-OS.tar.gz', where
     `VERSION' is a number (for example, `0.9.1'), and `OS' indicates
     the type of operating system for which the distribution is intended
     (for example, `linux').

  2. Pick the directory under which you want to unpack the
     distribution, and move into it.  In the example below, we unpack
     the distribution under `/usr/local' and create a directory
     `/usr/local/mysqlcc' into which MySQL Control Center is installed.
     (The following instructions therefore assume you have permission to
     create files in `/usr/local'.  If that directory is protected, you
     will need to perform the installation as `root'.)

  3. Change into the intended installation directory:

          shell> cd /usr/local

  4. Unpack the distribution and create the installation directory:

          shell> gunzip < /path/to/mysqlcc-VERSION-OS.tar.gz | tar xvf -
          shell> ln -s mysqlcc-VERSION-OS mysqlcc

     The first command creates a directory named `mysqlcc-VERSION-OS'.
     The second command makes a symbolic link to that directory.  This
     lets you refer more easily to the installation directory as
     `/usr/local/mysqlcc'.

  5. Change into the installation directory:

          shell> cd mysqlcc

After everything has been unpacked and installed, you should now be
able to execute mysqlcc and test your distribution.

You can start MySQL Control Center with the following command:

     shell> /usr/local/mysqlcc/mysqlcc


Note:  MySQL Control Center  is a Graphical GUI Client.  This means you
       will need to be running in an X environment before starting
       MySQL Control Center with the above command.


Windows Binary Installation
===========================

To install a binary distribution under Windows, follow the steps below:

  1. Obtain a Windows distribution file from one of the sites listed in
     *Note Getting MySQL: Getting MySQL.

     MySQL Control Center binary distributions for Windows are provided
     as compressed `zip' archives and have names like
     `mysqlcc-VERSION-OS.zip', where `VERSION' is a number (for example,
     `0.9.1'), and `OS' indicates the type of operating system for which
     the distribution is intended (for example, `win32').

  2. Unzip the Windows binary distribution to a directory  of it's own.

  3. Click on `Setup.exe` and follow the installation wizard.


Building MySQL Control Center
=============================

You need the following tools to create a MySQL Control Center binary from
the source distribution:

   * MySQL Control Center source distribution.
  
   * GNU `gunzip' to uncompress the distribution.  Windows users can use
     applications such as WinZip (C) and/or WinRAR (C).

   * A reasonable `tar' to unpack the distribution.  GNU `tar' is known
     to work.  Sun `tar' is known to have problems.  Windows users can
     use applications such as WinZip (C) and/or WinRAR (C).
     
   * A working ANSI C++ compiler.  gcc >= 2.95.3 < 3.2 are some of
     the compilers that are known to work.

     For Microsoft Windows Operating Systems, Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
     with the latest service pack is highly recommended.

   * A good `make' program.  GNU `make' is always recommended and is
     sometimes required.  If you have problems, we recommend trying GNU
     `make' 3.75 or newer.  Windows users will not need this.

   * MySQL Client libraries and headers need to be installed.  For more
     information, check http://www.mysql.com

   * Trolltech's Qt 3.0.5 or greater library is required to build this
     application from source.  For more information regarding Qt visit
     http://www.trolltech.com

   * MySQL 4.0.12 or greater is required to compile MySQLCC under Win32
     platforms.

   * MySQL 4.0.3 or greater is required to compile MySQLCC under Linux
     and Unix platforms.

Notes on Qt
-----------

It is highly recommended that you compile Qt with the following options
enabled:

     -thread
     -shared

The source distribution of MySQL Control Center assumes you have compiled
Qt with the above settings.  If Qt was compiled differently, you will have
to modify mysqlcc.pro.in and the generated Makefile in order to compile
MySQL Control Center correctly.

You probably also want to add the following options to fully enable
graphics support in MySQL Control Center:

     -qt-gif
     -qt-imgfmt-png
     -qt-imgfmt-jpeg
     -qt-imgfmt-mng

Our statically built binary links against Qt compiled in the with the
following configure arguments:

     -static
     -qt-gif
     -thread
     -no-stl
     -qt-imgfmt-png
     -qt-imgfmt-jpeg
     -qt-imgfmt-mng

For more information on building the Qt library, read the "Installation"
section of the Qt manual.


Compiling MySQL Control Center under Linux/Unix
-----------------------------------------------

The basic commands you must execute to install a *MySQL Control Center*
source distribution are:

     shell> gunzip < mysqlcc-VERSION.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
     shell> cd mysqlcc-VERSION
     shell> ./configure
     shell> make

For a list of possible configure options type:
     shell> ./configure --help


Compiling MySQL Control Center under Microsoft Windows
------------------------------------------------------

The basic steps for compiling *MySQL Control Center* under a Windows
environment are:

     * Unzip the source distribution.

     * copy the file win32/mysqlcc.pro to the root directory of
       the unziped source distribution

     * Edit mysqlcc.pro and make sure the `LIBS` and `INCLUDEPATH`
       directives point to the correct places.

     * from the command prompt, type:
       C:\path>qmake -t vcapp -o mysqlcc.dsp mysqlcc.pro

       The above command will create a file called mysqlcc.dsp

     * Open the newly created file `mysqlcc.dsp' in Microsoft Visual C++
       and select the `Build' option from the `Project' menu.
