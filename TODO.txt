Things that need to be done in MySQL Control Center
===================================================
The following are a list of things that need to be done in MySQL Control Center.
Since MySQL Control Center is still in early development stages, this file will
be modified constantly upon user input.
Things that need to be done
===========================

*filter out/in various types of threads from the 
process list. For example, I'd like to look at only threads with a Command of 
"Query" or only ones that aren't locked or asleep.

*Write Documentation
  Instructions
  FAQ
  HTML Help (manual)
  Make each Widget respond to "What's This ?" 

*Currently MySQL Control Center accesses the mysql database to get a list of
usernames. This needs to be rewritten as soon as the Server supports
SHOW GRANTS FOR '%' .

*Add SSL support for MySQL 4

*Add REQUIRE to CUserAdminWindow

*Have an option for "One connection only" for each registered
server.

*CQueryWindow
  Open Results in new window.
  Print Query Results

*MySQLDump Wrapper
  Backup & Restore Tables using MySQLDump (With "Use Transaction" option)
  Copy tables between DB's / Servers
  Add BACKUP Capabilities (Depends on MySQLDump Wrapper)

*Reporting Engine 

*Replication Wrapper

*MySQLMulti Wrapper

*Need option "Hide Disconnected Items" for CDatabaseTree

THINGS WE DON'T HAVE PLANS FOR
==============================
* Support for MySQL <= 3.21


KNOWN BUGS FOR THIS VERSION
===========================
*Inserting a precision value in a integer field will cause some errors when trying to
modify that record again unless the query is refreshed. This is because mysql rounds
precision values to the nearest integer when inserted into an integer field.

*A similar problem to the above happens when inserting negative values to unsigned fields.
mysql treats negative values in unsigned columns as 0 which is misleading!

*Sound not working in Linux ... It can only be enabled when QT is compiled with
the NAS option. It would be nice if QT didn't depend on it.
