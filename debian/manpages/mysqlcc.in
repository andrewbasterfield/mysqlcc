DESCRIPTION

  MySQL Control Center (also known as MySQLCC) is a 
  platform-independent GUI administration client for 
  the MySQL database server. 

 Features:
   * Interactive queries with a syntax-highlighting SQL editor

      With MySQLCC, you can construct queries using 
      a syntax-highlighting text editor, and then view 
      the results in a configurable table display. 
      The table view includes support for viewing 
      images stored in BLOB fields.

   * Database and table management

      MySQLCC makes it easy to create and manage 
      databases and tables, including views for all of 
      the table and field attributes such as comments 
      and key lengths. You can also check, repair, and 
      optimize tables.

   * Server administration

      You can easily view and change server variables, 
      as well as view server status information. MySQLCC 
      also supports multiple servers.

   * Cross-platform

      MySQLCC uses Trolltech's Qt toolkit, which means it 
      can run on Microsoft Windows and Unix environments, 
      and we plan on support Mac OS X in future versions.
